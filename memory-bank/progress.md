## Current Status

The application is currently in a functional state with all core features implemented. It provides a solid foundation for task management with boards, categories, tasks, and custom fields. The UI is clean and responsive, with good user experience considerations.

Recent work has focused on enhancing the user experience with improvements to markdown rendering, particularly for inline code blocks in task descriptions. This addresses the need for proper formatting of technical content within task descriptions.

The application is still under active development with ongoing enhancements to existing features and bug fixes as needed. While the core functionality is complete, there are still opportunities for refinement and extension in the areas listed above.

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
- Occasionally, inline code in markdown may not render correctly, requiring further refinement
- Some responsive design elements could be improved for very small screens
- Loading states could be enhanced for better user feedback

### Technical Issues
- Limited error handling for some edge cases
- Optimization needed for boards with very large numbers of tasks
- Some browser warnings appear in console that should be addressed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Initially started with simpler state management, evolved to use TanStack Query for better caching and synchronization
- Moved from simple in-memory storage to PostgreSQL for production-ready data persistence
- Enhanced the event logging system to provide more detailed audit trails

### UI Framework Evolution
- Started with basic React components, later integrated Shadcn/ui for improved design consistency
- Added Tailwind CSS for more flexible styling capabilities
- Incorporated additional UI libraries as needed for specific functionality (markdown, drag-drop)

### Feature Prioritization
1. First prioritized core task management (boards, categories, tasks)
2. Then added authentication and user management
3. Added custom fields for enhanced flexibility
4. Implemented archiving functionality for data lifecycle management
5. Enhanced markdown support for better content formatting
6. Recently focused on UI refinements and bug fixes

### Development Approach
- Initially focused on rapid development of core features
- Later shifted to more incremental improvements and refinements
- Increased emphasis on user experience and polish
- Growing focus on performance and scalability considerations
