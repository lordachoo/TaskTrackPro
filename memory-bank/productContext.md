# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This personal task management application was created to address the limitations of existing tools by providing a highly customizable platform that adapts to individual or company workflows. Many existing tools are either too rigid in their structure or too complex in their implementation. This application strikes a balance between flexibility and usability, allowing users to create a system that works specifically for their needs.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Workflow Customization
Many task management tools force users into predefined workflows. This application allows complete customization of boards, categories, and task attributes through custom fields, enabling users to model their exact workflow requirements.

### 2. Information Organization
Gathering and organizing information across multiple projects can be challenging. The application solves this through:
- Multiple board support for different project contexts
- Custom fields to capture and standardize project-specific data
- Hierarchical organization with boards > categories > tasks

### 3. Task Visibility and Prioritization
When managing multiple tasks, prioritization and visibility become critical. The application addresses this with:
- Visual category organization
- Priority levels for tasks
- Due date tracking
- Task filtering and sorting capabilities
- Clear visual indicators (colors, badges)

### 4. Accountability and Tracking
For teams or individuals needing to track activities over time, the application provides:
- Comprehensive event logging
- Task history and audit trails
- User assignment tracking
- Archives for completed or deprecated tasks/boards

## How It Should Work

### Task Management Flow
1. Users create boards to represent projects or areas of responsibility
2. Within boards, users define categories that represent workflow stages
3. Tasks are created within categories with required information
4. Tasks can be dragged between categories as they progress
5. Tasks can be edited, archived, or deleted as needed
6. Custom fields capture additional context-specific information

### Content Organization
- Boards organize high-level divisions (projects, departments, etc.)
- Categories represent workflow stages or classifications
- Tasks contain the actual work items with all relevant details
- Custom fields extend task data for specific needs

### User Experience Flow
1. Authentication grants access to the user's boards
2. Dashboard presents active boards with summary information
3. Board view displays all categories and tasks
4. Task cards show summary information
5. Task detail view provides full information and editing capabilities
6. Settings area allows customization of boards, fields, and user preferences
