# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The development team is currently focused on enhancing the UI/UX experience and fixing specific rendering issues in the application, particularly around markdown formatting in task descriptions.

### Recent Completed Work
- Fixed an issue where non-archived boards were incorrectly appearing in the Archived boards section
- Modified the task form to properly display and edit multiple URL-type custom fields in the same task
- Enhanced markdown rendering in task descriptions to make links open in new tabs with target="_blank" attribute
- Implemented centralized version management with APP_VERSION and APP_NAME constants for easier updates

### Active Task
Most recently, work has focused on improving markdown rendering in task descriptions, specifically:
- Fixing the rendering of inline code blocks in markdown text
- Ensuring inline code (with single backticks) displays properly without showing the backticks
- Making inline code visually distinct but properly integrated with surrounding text

## Recent Changes

### Markdown Rendering Improvements
The team has updated the TaskCard.tsx component to better handle markdown rendering. Key changes include:
1. Customizing the ReactMarkdown component to properly render inline code blocks
2. Adding target="_blank" attribute to links in markdown text
3. Using CSS styling to make inline code visually distinct but integrated with text flow
4. Using spans instead of pre/code elements for inline code to avoid layout issues

### UI Refinements
1. Enhanced styling for inline code blocks in task descriptions
2. Improved link handling in markdown with proper security attributes (rel="noopener noreferrer")
3. Fixed event propagation for links within task cards

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Verify that inline code formatting is working correctly in various contexts
2. Address any remaining issues with markdown rendering
3. Consider additional markdown features that might enhance task descriptions

### Near-Term Priorities
1. Continue improving the UI/UX with focus on consistency and responsiveness
2. Enhance performance for boards with many tasks
3. Improve custom field handling and display options
4. Consider additional customization options for task cards

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI/UX Approach
- Use subtle styling for code blocks that integrates with text while remaining distinct
- Maintain consistent visual language across the application
- Prioritize readability and usability over visual complexity

### Technical Decisions
- Use custom React components to override markdown rendering behavior
- Implement inline styles when necessary for specific rendering requirements
- Balance between raw HTML manipulation and React component patterns

### User Experience Priorities
- Ensure markdown content is properly formatted and readable
- Make links and interactive elements clearly identifiable
- Maintain performance even with complex rendering requirements

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Structure
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for reusable functionality
- Strong typing with TypeScript for code quality

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- Shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements
- Custom styling only when necessary for specific requirements

### Development Workflow
- Task-driven development focused on user-facing features
- Incremental improvements to existing functionality
- Prioritize fixing issues that impact user experience

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- ReactMarkdown component requires careful override of rendering behavior for inline elements
- DOM nesting warnings can indicate structural issues in rendered output
- CSS styling considerations are important for maintaining text flow with inline elements

### Project Evolution
- The application has matured from basic task management to a more robust platform
- Increased focus on polish and refinement of existing features
- Growing emphasis on handling edge cases and improving user experience details

### User Feedback Themes
- Users appreciate the flexibility of custom fields
- Clear visual distinction between different types of content is important
- Markdown support enhances the utility of task descriptions
